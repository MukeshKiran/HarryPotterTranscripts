    <dl><dd><i>[In the clouds during sunset, we see the Warner Bros. Pictures shield moving towards the screen and rotates out of the shot. Then, the film's title in golden letters slowly zooms through the camera afterwards; it is a quiet summer evening in Surrey. <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> is in his bedroom looking at the picture book that Rubeus Hagrid gave him at the end of his first year at Hogwarts; he looks at the picture of him as a baby with his parents, then turns the page to look at a picture of him with his closest friends, <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ron Weasley</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione Granger</a>; he then hears his owl Hedwig chirping and hooting in her cage.]</i>
    </dd><dd><b>Harry:</b> I can't let you out, Hedwig. I'm not allowed to use magic outside of school. <i>[Hedwig nibbles at her lock, squawking loudly]</i> Besides, if Uncle Vernon--
    </dd><dd><b>Vernon:</b> <i>[angrily from downstairs]</i> Harry Potter!
    </dd><dd><b>Harry:</b> <i>[glances downstairs then looks at Hedwig before closing his book and going downstairs]</i> Now you've done it.
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[In the kitchen, Petunia is working on a cake as Harry enters.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Petunia:</b> He's in there, Vernon.
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Harry enters the living room, where Uncle Vernon is getting Dudley dressed up.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Vernon:</b> I'm warning you. If you can't control that bloody bird, it'll have to go.
    </dd><dd><b>Harry:</b> But she's bored. If I could only let her out for... an hour or two.
    </dd><dd><b>Vernon:</b> <i>[chuckles]</i> So you can send secret messages to your freaky little friends? No, sir.
    </dd><dd><b>Harry:</b> But I haven't had any messages from any of my friends. Not one. All summer.
    </dd><dd><b>Dudley:</b> Who would want to be friends with <i>you</i>? <i>[bumps Harry harshly]</i>
    </dd><dd><b>Vernon:</b> I should think you'd be a little more grateful. We've raised you since you a were a baby, given you the food off our table, even let you have Dudley's second bedroom, purely out of the goodness of our hearts.
    </dd><dd><b>Petunia:</b> <i>[to Dudley]</i> Not now, bumpkins. It's for when the Masons arrive.
    </dd><dd><b>Vernon:</b> Which should be any minute. <i>[motions for his family to come into the living room]</i> Now, let's go over our schedule once again, shall we? Petunia, when the Masons arrive, you will be...?
    </dd><dd><b>Petunia:</b> In the lounge, waiting to welcome them graciously to our home.
    </dd><dd><b>Vernon:</b> Good. And, Dudley, you will be...?
    </dd><dd><b>Dudley:</b> I'll be waiting to open the door.
    </dd><dd><b>Vernon:</b> Excellent. <i>[the three of them turn to Harry with scornful looks]</i> And you...?
    </dd><dd><b>Harry:</b> I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending that I don't exist.
    </dd><dd><b>Vernon:</b> Too right you will. With any luck, this could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career, and you will <i>not</i> mess it up.
    </dd></dl>
    <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Dobby.27s_Warning">Dobby's Warning</span></h2>
    <p><i>[Harry goes upstairs as the doorbell rings.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Vernon:</b> <i>[from below]</i> Mr. and Mrs. Mason! Do come in!
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Harry hears someone laughing madly in his room. He opens the door to find, a house elf named Dobby bouncing on his bed.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Dobby:</b> Harry Potter! Such an honor it is! <i>[Harry closes the door.]</i>
    </dd><dd><b>Harry:</b> Who are you?
    </dd><dd><b>Dobby:</b> Dobby sir, Dobby the house elf.
    </dd><dd><b>Harry:</b> Not to be to be rude or anything, but this isn’t a great time for me to have a house elf in my bedroom.
    </dd><dd><b>Dobby:</b> Oh, oh, yes, sir! Dobby understands! It’s just that, Dobby has come to tell you- it is difficult, sir- Dobby wonders where to begin?
    </dd><dd><b>Harry:</b> Why don’t you sit down?
    </dd><dd><b>Dobby:</b> S-sit down? S-sit- sit down? <i>[he soon begins to cry]</i>
    </dd><dd><b>Harry:</b> Dobby, ssh! I’m sorry! <i>[Dobby cries louder]</i> I didn’t mean to offend you, or anything.
    </dd><dd><b>Dobby:</b> <i>[stops crying when he hears that word]</i> Offend Dobby? Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir, but never has he been asked to sit down by a wizard, like an equal.
    </dd><dd><b>Harry:</b> You can’t have met many decent wizards then.
    </dd><dd><b>Dobby:</b> No, I haven’t. That was an awful thing to say. <i>[he then bangs his head on the dresser drawer repeatedly]</i> Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!
    </dd><dd><b>Harry:</b> Stop, Dobby! Dobby, shh! Dobby, please stop!
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[From downstairs in the living room, the Dursleys and the Masons are having some wine as they hear the banging from above.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Vernon:</b> Oh, don't mind that. It's just the... cat! <i>[he chuckles lightly, as Mr. and Mrs Mason look on, being convinced and concerned at the same time.]</i>
    </dd><dd><b>Dobby:</b> <i>[still banging his head on the drawer]</i> Bad Dobby!
    </dd><dd><b>Harry:</b> Dobby, stop! Please be quiet. Are you all right?
    </dd><dd><b>Dobby:</b> Dobby had to punish himself, sir. <i>[pushes a stool closer to Harry]</i> Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir.
    </dd><dd><b>Harry:</b> Your family?
    </dd><dd><b>Dobby:</b> The wizard family Dobby serves, sir. <i>[gets up and sits on the stool]</i> Dobby is bound to serve one family forever. If they knew Dobby was here... <i>[shivers]</i> But Dobby had to come. Dobby has to protect Harry Potter. To warn him. Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year. <i>[Harry looks at him in surprise]</i> There is a plot, a plot to make most terrible things happen.
    </dd><dd><b>Harry:</b> What terrible things? Who’s plotting them?
    </dd><dd><b>Dobby:</b> <i>[trying to resist himself from saying something]</i> Oh, he! Can’t say!
    </dd><dd><b>Harry:</b> Okay, I understand. You can’t say.
    </dd><dd><b>Dobby:</b> Don’t make me talk. L-- <i>[Dobby gets on the desk, grabs the lamp and hits himself with it.]</i> Bad Dobby!
    </dd><dd><b>Harry:</b> Dobby? Dobby, put the lamp down. <i>[he keeps hitting himself, in the living room, Vernon is still doing his conversation with the Masons.]</i>
    </dd><dd><b>Vernon:</b> So, when they arrive at the ninth hole-- <i>[Dobby’s shout is heard, Vernon hears it upstairs while looking suspicious.]</i>
    </dd><dd><b>Harry:</b> <i>[trying to grab the lamp from Dobby]</i> Give me the lamp! <i>[Dobby keeps straining until Harry hears Vernon coming upstairs]</i> Dobby, stop! <i>[he finally grabs it from Dobby, grabs his rags, hides him in the closet, and closes the door]</i> Get in there and keep quiet!
    </dd><dd><b>Vernon:</b> <i>[opening the door, stomping into the room, and glaring at Harry]</i> What the devil are you doing up here?!
    </dd><dd><b>Harry:</b> I was just... <i>[Dobby slowly opens the closet door; Harry pushes it closed]</i>
    </dd><dd><b>Vernon:</b> You've just ruined the punchline of my Japanese golfer joke.
    </dd><dd><b>Harry:</b> Sorry. <i>[closes the closet door again]</i>
    </dd><dd><b>Vernon:</b> <i>[glances at the closet door, unaware of Dobby's presence, then lifts his finger as he turns his eyes back to Harry]</i> One more sound, and you'll wish you'd never born, boy. <i>[sees the closet door opening again]</i> And fix that door.
    </dd><dd><b>Harry:</b> <i>[closing the door again]</i> Yes, sir. <i>[Vernon glares at Harry as he walks out of the room, pulling the door closed; with Vernon gone, Harry opens the closet door to let Dobby out]</i> See why I've got to go back? <i>[Dobby removes a sock from his ear]</i> I don't belong here; I belong in your world, at Hogwarts. <i>[Dobby sniffs the sock and throws it aside and turns to Harry]</i> It's the only place I've got friends.

    <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Car_Rescue">Car Rescue</span></h2>
    <p><i>[Petunia and Dudley watch as Vernon drills bars into Harry's bedroom window.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Vernon:</b> <i>[after tightening the bars, he glares at Harry, who glares back at him through the window]</i> You're never going back to that school. You're never going to see those freaky friends of yours again. Never!
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Later that evening, as Harry is asleep in bed, he hears what sounds like a car engine outside. Waking up and putting on his glasses, he gets out of bed and walks to the window. Looking out the window, he sees a strange object moving through the sky. As he looks, the object appears to be a shooting star, before turning into two beams of light. A turquoise Ford Anglia car flies to Harry's bedroom window, then turns to the right as Harry and Hedwig silently watch. In the Ford Anglia is Ron, accompanied by his older twins, Fred and George.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Ron:</b> <i>[looking at Harry through the bars on his window]</i> Hiya, Harry.
    </dd><dd><b>Harry:</b> <i>[surprised to see his friends]</i> Ron, Fred, George, what are you all doing here?
    </dd><dd><b>Ron:</b> Rescuing you, of course. Now, come on. Get your trunk!
    </dd></dl>
    <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Burrow">The Burrow</span></h2>
    <dl><dd><b>Fred:</b> <i>[walking to the window and opening it to unlock the door]</i> Come on. Okay, come on. Shhh! Shhh! <i>[checking that the coast is clear then beckoning the others inside]</i> Okay, come on.

    <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Flourish_and_Blotts">Flourish and Blotts</span></h2>
    <dl><dd><i>[A copy of <a href="/wiki/Gilderoy_Lockhart" title="Gilderoy Lockhart">Gilderoy Lockhart</a>'s autobiography "Magical Me" is on display as Harry and Hermione enter the store.]</i>
    </dd></dl>
    <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Flying_to_Hogwarts">Flying to Hogwarts</span></h2>
    <p><i>[The Ford Anglia is parked at King's Cross Station as numerous people walk past it. In the station, Harry, Ron, Ginny, Percy, Fred, George, Mr. and Mrs. Weasley are desperate to catch the Hogwarts Express before it leaves.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Mr. Weasley:</b> 10:58. Come on, come on!
    </dd><dd><b>Mrs. Weasley:</b> Train will be leaving any moment!
    </dd><dd><b>Mr. Weasley:</b> Fred, George, Percy, you first! <i>[Fred pushes his cart through the barrier to Platform 9¾, followed by Percy and George]</i>
    </dd><dd><b>Mrs. Weasley:</b> <i>[patting Ginny on the back]</i> Okay. <i>[Ginny pushes her cart and runs through the wall; Mr. and Mrs. Weasley follow]</i>
    </dd><dd><b>Mr. Weasley:</b> After you, dear. <i>[Mrs. Weasley disappears through the wall; Mr. Weasley goes in immediately after her]</i>
    </dd><dd><b>Mrs. Weasley:</b> <i>[meeting up with Ginny as she stands by the Hogwarts Express, which is just about ready to go]</i> Come on, Ginny. We'll get you a seat. Hurry! <i>[the three run for the train; outside, only Harry and Ron are left]</i>
    </dd><dd><b>Harry:</b> <i>[turning to Ron]</i> Let's go.
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Ron nods; then the two boys push their carts directly for the wall. However, instead of going through the wall, Harry inexplicably crashes into it and falls over; Ron loses control of his cart, and falls over as well. A station agent, the same man Harry saw a year ago, notices while speaking to a woman, and approaches Harry and Ron as they get to their feet, groaning from their slight injuries.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Station Agent:</b> Oy! What do you two think you're doing?
    </dd><dd><b>Harry:</b> Sorry. Lo-lost control of the trolley. <i>[the agent shakes his head at them and walks away; Harry glances at Ron]</i> Why can't we get through?
    </dd><dd><b>Ron:</b> I don't know. <i>[touching the wall with his hand, discovering the bricks have become solid]</i> The gateway's sealed itself for some reason. <i>[Harry touches the wall to see that it's completely solid]</i>
    </dd><dd><b>Harry:</b> <i>[hearing a clock chime, he and Ron look up at a nearby clock displaying the time 11:00]</i> The train leaves at exactly 11:00. We've missed it!
    </dd><dd><b>Ron:</b> <i>[glancing at the clock in horror, then turning to Harry]</i> Harry... if we can't get through, maybe mom and dad can't get back.
    </dd><dd><b>Harry:</b> <i>[trying to decide what to do about their dilemma]</i> Maybe we should just go and wait by the car.
    </dd><dd><b>Ron:</b> <i>[the sound of these words suddenly gives him an idea]</i> The car... <i>[Harry glances at him, wondering what he's got in mind]</i>

    <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Whomping_Willow">Whomping Willow</span></h2>
    <p><i>[As the Ford Anglia flies alongside the Hogwarts Express, it puts on its headlights and flies off. Soon enough, Harry and Ron are flying over the lake, and have arrived at Hogwarts.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Ron:</b> <i>[glancing at the castle with a smile as he turns to face Harry]</i> Welcome home. <i>[Harry smiles, happy to be back at Hogwarts after such an unpleasant summer]</i>

    <p><i>[Harry and Ron walk into the Entrance Hall with their belongings and pets, which they leave with the rest of the students' luggage.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Harry:</b> See you, Hedwig! <i>[he and Ron then run up the steps]</i> So a house-elf shows up in my bedroom, we can't get through the barrier to Platform 9¾, we almost get killed by a tree... clearly someone doesn't want me here this year. <i>[reaching the top of the stairs, they come face-to-face with the caretaker, <a href="/wiki/Argus_Filch" title="Argus Filch">Argus Filch</a> and his pet cat, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mrs._Norris" title="Mrs. Norris">Mrs. Norris</a>]</i>
    </dd><dd><b>Filch:</b> <i>[glaring at them with a malicious smile]</i> Well, take a good look, lads. This night might well be the last you spend in this castle. <i>[Harry and Ron glance at each other nervously]</i> Oh, dear, we are in trouble. <i>[he smiles more devilishly; moments later, Harry and Ron are standing in <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a>'s classroom]</i>
    </dd><dd><b>Snape:</b> <i>[holding up a newspaper article about their flying car at King's Cross Station]</i> You were seen by no less than seven Muggles! <i>[furiously throws the newspaper aside and glares at them]</i> Do you have any idea how serious this is? You have risked the exposure of our world. Not to mention the damage you inflicted on a Whomping Willow that's been on these grounds since before you were born!
    </dd><dd><b>Ron:</b> Honestly, Professor Snape, I think it did more damage to us.
    </dd><dd><b>Snape:</b> Silence! <i>[walking around his desk towards them]</i> I assure you... that were you in Slytherin and your fate rested with me, the both of you would be on the train home tonight! As it is.
    </dd><dd><b><a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Dumbledore</a>:</b> They are not. <i>[Harry, Ron, Snape, and Filch turn towards the doorway to see Dumbledore standing there, accompanied by his associate, <a href="/wiki/Minerva_McGonagall" title="Minerva McGonagall">Professor McGonagall</a>. Both of them are looking stern.]</i>
    </dd><dd><b>Harry:</b> <i>[glancing at Dumbledore and McGonagall]</i> Professor Dumbledore, Professor McGonagall.
    </dd><dd><b>Snape</b>: Headmaster, these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry. As such...
    </dd><dd><b>Dumbledore</b>: I'm well aware of our bylaws, Severus, having written more than a few myself. However, as Head of Gryffindor House, it is for Professor McGonagall to determine the appropriate action.
    </dd><dd><b>Ron</b>: We'll go and get our stuff.
    </dd><dd><b>McGonagall</b>: What are you talking about, Mr. Weasley?
    </dd><dd><b>Ron</b>: Well, you're going to expel us, aren't you?
    </dd><dd><b>McGonagall:</b> Not today, Mr. Weasley. But I must impress upon both of you the seriousness of what you have done. I will be writing to your families tonight. And you will both receive detention.
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Harry and Ron turn back to Snape who casts a glare of pure venom at them]</i>
    </p><p><b>(Extended Version)</b>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Dumbledore</b>: And now I suggest that we all return to the feast. There is a delicious-looking custard tart that I am most anxious to sample.
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Dumbledore and McGonagall exit the office and Snape follows behind with a disapproving facial expression.</i>
    Harry and Ron pass Filch. Harry notices a envelope on the ground and picks it up. It's addressed to Filch and is about the basics of magic.]
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Harry</b>: Eh, Mr. Filch, you dropped this.
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Filch eyes the envelope before he grabs it and stuffs it in his pocket fast while looking flabbergasted. Harry and Ron walk on.]</i>

We are going to train earlier, harder, and longer. <i>[glancing to his left, the rest of the team follows his gaze]</i> What...? I don't believe it. <i>[stepping out into the courtyard, they come across the Slytherin Quidditch team, also dressed for Quidditch, as Ron and Hermione are sitting nearby; Oliver directs his attention to the team's captain, Marcus Flint]</i> Where do you think you're going, Flint?

    </dd><dd><b>Hermione:</b> Professor, I was wondering if you could tell us about the Chamber of Secrets. <i>[Draco gives Hermione a surprised look]</i>
    </dd><dd><b>McGonagall:</b> <i>[glancing around the room and seeing that the students look somewhat interested]</i> Very well. Well, you all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age: <a href="/wiki/Godric_Gryffindor" title="Godric Gryffindor">Godric Gryffindor</a>, <a href="/wiki/Helga_Hufflepuff" title="Helga Hufflepuff">Helga Hufflepuff</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rowena_Ravenclaw" title="Rowena Ravenclaw">Rowena Ravenclaw</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Salazar_Slytherin" title="Salazar Slytherin">Salazar Slytherin</a>. Now three of the founders coexisted quite harmoniously. One did not.
    </dd><dd><b>Ron:</b> <i>[turns to Harry]</i> Three guesses who.
    </dd><dd><b>McGonagall:</b> Salazar Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed magical learning should be kept within all-magic families. In other words, pure-bloods. <i>[Hermione and Draco glare at each other]</i> Unable to sway the others, he decided to leave the school. Now, according to legend, Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle, known as the Chamber of Secrets. Well, shortly before departing, he sealed it, until that time when his own true heir returned to the school. The Heir alone would be able to open the Chamber, and unleash the horror within, and by so doing, purge the school of all those who, in Slytherin's view, were unworthy to study magic.
    </dd><dd><b>Hermione:</b> Muggle-borns. <i>[Professor McGonagall points her wand at her in an affirmative gesture]</i>
    </dd><dd><b>McGonagall:</b> Well, naturally the school has been searched many times. No such Chamber has been found. <i>[turns and walks back to her desk]</i>
    </dd><dd><b>Hermione:</b> Professor, <i>[Professor McGonagall turns around]</i> what exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber?
    </dd><dd><b> McGonagall:</b> Well, the Chamber is said to be home to something that only the Heir of Slytherin can control. It is said to be the home of a monster. <i>[Hermione feels a sense of dread at these words; a horrified Ron turns around to look at Draco, who grins smugly at him]</i>
    </dd><dd><b>Ron:</b> <i>[as he, Harry, and Hermione walk down the corridor]</i> Do you think it's true? Do you really think there is a Chamber of Secrets?
    </dd><dd><b>Hermione:</b> Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall's worried. All the teachers are.
    </dd><dd><b>Harry:</b> <i>[as Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle walk down the corridor behind them]</i> But if there really is a Chamber of Secrets, and it really has been opened, then that means...
    </dd><dd><b>Hermione:</b> The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?
    </dd><dd><b>Ron:</b> <i>[as Draco and Goyle walk past them, with Crabbe running to keep up]</i> Let's think... <i>[glances at their adversaries as they pass]</i> who do we know who thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?
    </dd><dd><b>Hermione:</b> If you're talking about Malfoy...
    </dd><dd><b>Ron:</b> Of course! You heard him: "You'll be next, mudbloods."
    </dd><dd><b>Hermione:</b> I heard him. But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?
    </dd><dd><b>Harry:</b> Well, maybe Ron's right, Hermione. I mean, look at his family, the whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries.
    </dd><dd><b>Ron:</b> Crabbe and Goyle must know. Maybe we could trick them into telling.
    </dd><dd><b>Hermione:</b> Even they aren't <i>that</i> thick. But there might be another way. Mind you, it would be difficult, not to mention, we'd be breaking fifty school rules, and it'll be dangerous, <i>very</i> dangerous.

    </dd></dl>
    <dl><dd><b>Harry:</b> But why?
    </dd></dl>
    <dl><dd><b>Riddle:</b> Because I told her to. You'll find I can be very persuasive. Not that she knew what she was doing. She was, shall we say, in a kind of trance. <i>[as Ginny is shown running into a stall and throwing the diary into the toilet]</i> Still, the power of the diary began to scare her. And she tried to dispose of it in the girls' bathroom. And then, who should find it but you? The very person I was most anxious to meet.
    </dd></dl>
    <dl><dd><b>Harry:</b> <i>[stands in front of the Slytherin statue]</i> And why did you want to meet me?
    </dd></dl>
    <dl><dd><b>Riddle:</b> I knew I had to talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf Hagrid to gain your trust.
    </dd></dl>
    <dl><dd><b>Harry:</b> <i>[angrily]</i> Hagrid's my friend! <i>[calms down slightly]</i> And you framed him, didn't you?
    </dd></dl>
    <dl><dd><b>Riddle:</b> It was my word against Hagrid's. Only Dumbledore seemed to think he was innocent.
    </dd></dl>
    <dl><dd><b>Harry:</b> <i>[smirks at him]</i> I'll bet Dumbledore saw right through you.
    </dd></dl>
    <dl><dd><b>Riddle:</b> He certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after that. <i>[walks around Harry as he speaks]</i> I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at school, so I decided to leave behind a diary, preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages, so that one day, I would be able to lead another, to finish Salazar Slytherin's noble work.
    </dd></dl>
    <dl><dd><b>Harry:</b> Well, you haven't finished it this time. In a few hours, the Mandrake draught will be ready. And everyone who was Petrified will be all right again.
    </dd></dl>
    <dl><dd><b>Riddle:</b> <i>[smiles maliciously]</i> Haven't I told you? Killing Mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore.

How did you escape <i>[pushes Harry's hair aside with his wand to see his scar]</i> with nothing but a scar while Lord Voldemort's powers were destroyed?
    </dd></dl>
    <dl><dd><b>Harry:</b> Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time.

    <dl><dd><b>Riddle:</b> <i>[smiles wickedly]</i> Voldemort is... my past, present, and future. <i>[turns toward the statue and uses Harry's wand to write his full name in flaming letters; after writing the "E", he flicks the wand, and the letters rearrange themselves to say "I AM LORD VOLDEMORT]</i>

    <dl><dd><b>Harry:</b> <i>[as the letters fade and Riddle turns to face him]</i> You. You're the Heir of Slytherin. <i>[Riddle stares evilly at Harry]</i> You're Voldemort.
    </dd></dl>
    <dl><dd><b>Riddle:</b> Surely, you didn't think I was going to keep my filthy Muggle father's name? No. I fashioned myself a new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak when I became the greatest sorcerer in the world!

    <dl><dd><b>Harry:</b> Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world!
    </dd></dl>

Harry throws the Sorting Hat onto the floor in front of Ginny and races back towards the door to the Chamber as the Basilisk's head comes out of the statue's mouth and its snake-like body lowers into the surrounding water; Riddle, immune to the Basilisk's lethal gaze, watches the creature.]</i>

Just as the Basilisk is about to attack Harry, Fawkes emits his cry, getting their attention. Fawkes swoops down, going directly for the Basilisk, and attacks the colossal snake, pecking at it, with Harry observing their fight by watching their shadows on the wall.]</i>

At the same time, the Basilisk stops thrashing about and blindly glares at Harry, who looks up again and makes a run for a passageway to his right. The Basilisk lunges at Harry, nearly getting him. Harry, breathing heavily, runs as fast as he can, into a tunnel just to his left as the Basilisk lunges at him again, smashing through a stalactite. Harry runs through the tunnel, looking back to see if the Basilisk is still behind him; he turns left into an alcove, only to find his path blocked by a grate. He struggles to move it, but turns around upon hearing the Basilisk coming into the tunnel. He steps back against the grate, as the Basilisk comes to his position. The Basilisk hisses at him and approaches him with its mouth open. Harry picks up a rock at his feet and throws it; the sound of the rock distracts the Basilisk, who slithers off into another passageway.

The Basilisk uses its tongue again to find Harry's current position directly in front of it; Harry swings the sword at the Basilisk; it lunges directly at him, he dodges, and it smashes right into the statue. Harry climbs higher as the Basilisk lunges at him again, missing again; Harry climbs onto the top of the statue's head, the Basilisk lunges at Harry repeatedly as he swings the sword wildly at the creature.

The Basilisk bellows in pain until Harry pulls the sword out. Harry screams in pain as one of the Basilisk's venomous fangs just fell into his arm; he pulls the fang out, unfortunately, the venom is already in his bloodstream. The Basilisk thrashes around, roaring and bellowing in pain, collapsing under its weight, and falls backwards to the floor, dead, splashing water everywhere; Riddle stares at the Basilisk's corpse in disbelief.]</i>

    <dl><dd><b>Riddle:</b> Remarkable, isn't it? How quickly the venom of the Basilisk penetrates the body. I guess you have little more than a minute to live. You'll be with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry. <i>[Harry extends his left hand to Ginny's again]</i> Funny... the damage a silly little book can do... especially in the hands of a silly little girl. <i>[Harry looks to the diary in Ginny's arm and carefully pulls it out, placing it on the floor between her and the Basilisk fang]</i> What are you doing? <i>[Harry picks up the Basilisk fang and holds it up while staring at Riddle, who immediately realizes what Harry is about to do]</i> Stop. No!

    <dl><dd><i>[Harry stabs one of the diary's pages with the fang as Riddle steps forward to try and stop him; Riddle's body crumbles and gives a discharge of yellow light; ink starts to ooze from the diary, Riddle recoils and growls with rage; Harry pries the fang out. Riddle attempts to attack, but Harry stabs the other page, crippling Riddle, and causing him to crumble further; Harry closes the diary and stabs the cover with the Basilisk fang; Riddle screams in agony and disintegrates into yellow particles; shortly after Riddle's demise, Ginny awakens, hyperventilating, and sits up.]</i>

    </dd></dl>
    <dl><dd><b>Harry:</b> <i>[covering his wound]</i> Don't worry. Ginny, you need to get yourself out. Follow the Chamber, and you'll find Ron. <i>[Fawkes emits his song again; Harry and Ginny both look down the corridor to see him flying towards them; he swoops around the Basilisk's body, and lands in between them, then steps over to Harry]</i> You were brilliant, Fawkes. I just wasn't quick enough. <i>[Fawkes emits a soft grunt, then lowers his head to Harry's wound, and cries on it; the wound miraculously disappears; Ginny stares in amazement]</i> Of course! <i>[lifting his healed arm]</i> Phoenix tears have healing powers. <i>[Fawkes grunts affirmatively as Harry glances at him]</i> Thanks. <i>[looks at Ginny]</i> It's all right, Ginny. It's over. It's just a memory.

    <dl><dd><i>[Harry and Ron stand before Professor Dumbledore in his office, with Fawkes on his perch, and the sword and Sorting Hat resting on the desk.]</i>
    </dd></dl>
    <dl><dd><b>Professor Dumbledore:</b> You both realize, of course, that in the past few hours, you have broken, perhaps, a dozen school rules.
    </dd></dl>
    <dl><dd><b>Harry and Ron:</b> Yes, sir.
    </dd></dl>
    <dl><dd><b>Professor Dumbledore:</b> And there is sufficient evidence to have you both expelled.
    </dd></dl>
    <dl><dd><b>Harry and Ron:</b> Yes, sir.
    </dd></dl>
    <dl><dd><b>Professor Dumbledore:</b> Therefore, it is only fitting... <i>[Harry and Ron look up]</i> that you both receive special awards for services to the school. <i>[Harry and Ron look at each other with smiles, then back at Dumbledore again]</i>
    </dd></dl>
    <dl><dd><b>Ron:</b> Thanks, sir.
    </dd></dl>
    <dl><dd><b>Professor Dumbledore:</b> <i>[smiles at the boys, then stands up while handing some papers to Ron]</i> And now, Mr. Weasley, if you would, have an owl deliver these release papers to Azkaban. I believe we... we want our gamekeeper back. <i>[turns to Harry as Ron leaves the room]</i> Harry... first, I want to thank you, Harry. You must've shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could've called Fawkes to you. And, second... I sense something is troubling you. Am I right, Harry?
    </dd></dl>
    <dl><dd><b>Harry:</b> You see, sir. I couldn't help but notice certain things... certain... certain similarities between... Tom Riddle and me.
    </dd></dl>
    <dl><dd><b>Professor Dumbledore:</b> I see. Well, you can speak Parseltongue, Harry. Why? Because, Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue. If I'm not mistaken, Harry, he transferred some of his powers to you the night he gave you that scar.
    </dd></dl>
    <dl><dd><b>Harry:</b> <i>[amazed]</i> Voldemort transferred some of his powers... to me?
    </dd></dl>
    <dl><dd><b>Professor Dumbledore:</b> Uh-huh. Not intentionally. But yes.
    </dd></dl>
    <dl><dd><b>Harry:</b> <i>[as Dumbledore returns to his seat behind the desk]</i> So, the Sorting Hat was right; I should be in Slytherin.
    </dd></dl>
    <dl><dd><b>Professor Dumbledore:</b> It's true, Harry. You possess many of the qualities that Voldemort himself prizes: Determination, resourcefulness, and if I may so, a certain disregard for the rules. Why then, did the Sorting Hat place you in Gryffindor?
    </dd></dl>
    <dl><dd><b>Harry:</b> <i>[glancing at the Sorting Hat]</i> Because I asked it to.
    </dd></dl>
    <dl><dd><b>Professor Dumbledore:</b> Exactly, Harry, exactly. Which makes you different from Voldemort. It is not our abilities that show what we truly are, it is our choices. If you want proof why you belong in Gryffindor, then I suggest you look more closely <i>[picks up the sword]</i> at this. <i>[Harry takes the sword by the blade with his left hand, and its hilt with his right]</i> Be careful.
    </dd></dl>
    <dl><dd><b>Harry:</b> <i>[examines the sword and sees the name "Godric Gryffindor" on the Basilisk venom-coated blade]</i> Godric Gryffindor.

    <dl><dd><b>Harry:</b> Dobby! So this is your master. The family you serve is the Malfoys.

    <dl><dd><b>Dobby:</b> <i>[nervously looking at Harry]</i> Mm-hmm. <i>[fearfully glances up at Lucius]</i>

So... it's true. You have returned.
    </dd></dl>
    <dl><dd><b>Professor Dumbledore:</b> When the governors learned that Arthur Weasley's daughter was taken into the Chamber, they saw fit to summon me back.
