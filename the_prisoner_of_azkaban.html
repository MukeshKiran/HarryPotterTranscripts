<p><i>[It is pitch black, until we see what seems to be a small glow before it dims out. Then, the glow emits again, only bigger and revealing itself to be from a window, and then dims out. During all the while, a dog was heard barking. The glow from the window emits again, only this time, a familiar object was in front of the glow and as it dims out. The glow emits again and the dims away, just as the object then shines, revealing itself to be the Warner Bros. Pictures shield, in silver and the byline fades in underneath. The scenery behind the shield fades in from the darkness and the glow emits again, revealing to be Privet Drive and the glow is coming from Harry's bedroom and 4 Privet Drive. We zoom through the shield and towards the window]</i>

Until he hears a toilet flushing and immediately goes back to sleep just as Vernon opens the door and turns on the light. He looks around in confusion before he turns off the light and closes the door and heads back to his bedroom.

Lumos Maxima! <i>[The camera immediately zooms out from the covers, through the window where we see the film's title floating around in rays of light. We then zoom back into Harry's bedroom. As soon as Harry hears Vernon coming from his bedroom, he immediately returns to sleep just as Vernon opens the door and turns on the light. He looks around suspiciously just before he turns off the light and closes the door. Harry looks at the door and then smiles to himself before he really goes to sleep as we iris out.]</i>

<dl><dd><i>[Harry, Ron, and Hermione walk into the courtyard leading to the Covered Bridge]</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Hermione:</b> Beautiful day.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Ron:</b> Gorgeous. Unless, of course, you’ve been ripped to pieces!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Harry:</b> Ripped to pieces? What are you talking about?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Hermione:</b> Ronald has lost his rat.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Ron:</b> I haven’t lost anything! Your cat killed him!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Hermione:</b> Rubbish.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Ron:</b> Harry, you’ve seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers is always lurking about. And Scabbers is gone!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Hermione:</b> Well, maybe you should learn to take better care of your pets! <i>[Crookshanks climbs onto one of the stone walls behind them as they walk on to the Covered Bridge]</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Ron:</b> Your cat killed him!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Hermione:</b> Did not!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Ron:</b> Did.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Hermione:</b> Didn’t.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><i>[They meet up with Hagrid as he is skipping rocks at the lake.]</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Hermione:</b> How’d it go, Hagrid? The hearing?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Hagrid:</b> Well, first off, the Committee members took turns talking about why we were there. <i>[throws another rock bouncing across the lake]</i> Then, I got up and did my piece. Said how Buckbeak was a good hippogriff, always cleaned his feathers. And then, Lucius Malfoy got up. Well you can imagine, he said Buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature who would kill you as soon as look at you.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Hermione:</b> <i>[as Hagrid skips another rock]</i> And then?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Hagrid:</b> Then he asked for the worst, did old Lucius.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Ron:</b> <i>[obviously outraged]</i> They’re not sacking you?!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Hagrid:</b> No, I’m not sacked. <i>[skips yet another rock, then speaks with his voice breaking]</i> Buckbeak’s been sentenced to death!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><i>[He furiously throws his last rock in the water with a loud splash and sniffles; behind him, Harry stands up, shocked by the sound of these words; he, Ron, and Hermione walk up to the water’s edge as Hagrid lets out a sad sigh.]</i>

<dl><dd><i>[A scraping sound is heard, and a man is shown as he sits against the tree-like structure in the courtyard, with crows all around him. Harry, Ron, and Hermione step out, and see the man, <a href="/wiki/Walden_Macnair" title="Walden Macnair">Walden Macnair</a>, sharpening a massive axe blade. He looks up at them as they approach; Hermione scowls at him as she walks past, obviously knowing that he intends to use it on Buckbeak. Macnair looks at Harry and grins maliciously as he continues sharpening his axe. Harry, Ron, and Hermione walk along the Covered Bridge, heading to Hagrid's cabin.]</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Hermione:</b> I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak. It's just too horrible.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Ron:</b> <i>[as they reach the other end of the bridge]</i> It just got worse. <i>[they see Draco and his pals looking down at Hagrid’s house from the hilltop]</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Draco:</b> What did I tell you? Father said I can keep the hippogriff’s head. I think I’ll donate it to the Gryffindor’s common room. <i>[enraged, Hermione quickly walks towards Draco]</i> Oh, this is going to be rich.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Crabbe:</b> [seeing Harry and his friends approaching] Look who’s here.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Draco:</b> Ah, come to see the show? <i>[happily holds out his arms]</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Hermione:</b> You! You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach! <i>[points her wand at Malfoy’s throat in her rage]</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Ron:</b> Hermione, no! He’s not worth it. <i>[Draco stands there whimpering as Hermione keeps her wand against his throat, then lowers it and turns away. Draco chuckles; next second, Hermione spins around and punches him in the face.]</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Crabbe:</b> <i>[as he and the other boy help Draco to his feet]</i> Malfoy, are you okay? Let’s go! Quick!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Draco:</b> <i>[as he and his friends run to the bridge]</i> Not a word to anyone. Understood? I’m gonna get that jumped-up Mudblood! Mark my words!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Hermione:</b> That felt good.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Ron:</b> Not good. Brilliant.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><i>[Hermione smiles with satisfaction. The three of them then head down the steps to Hagrid’s house, walking past Buckbeak, who’s chained up in the pumpkin patch, awaiting his approaching execution.]</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Hagrid:</b> <i>[as he and Harry look out the window at Buckbeak]</i> Oh, look at him. Loves the smell of the trees when the wind blows through ‘em.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Harry:</b> Why don’t we just set him free?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Hagrid:</b> <i>[wishing he could, but knows that he can’t]</i> They’d know it was me, and then Dumbledore would get into trouble. He’s coming down, you know, Dumbledore. Says he wants to be with me when they... when it happens. <i>[walking away from the window]</i> Great man, Dumbledore. Great man. <i>[Hagrid’s flobberworm squeals; he throws it a piece of food, which it eats in one bite]</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Hermione:</b> We’ll stay with you, too, Hagrid.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Hagrid:</b> You’ll do no such thing! <i>[points at the window]</i> Think I want you seeing something like that? No! You just drink your tea and be off. Oh. Before you do, Ron... <i>[he picks up a plastic container and opens it and pulls Scabbers out]</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Ron:</b> <i>[overjoyed to see his rat alive]</i> Scabbers. You’re alive! <i>[takes Scabbers from Hagrid]</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Hagrid:</b> You want to keep a closer eye on your pets, Ron.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Hermione:</b> <i>[as Ron turns around]</i> I think that means you owe someone an apology.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Ron:</b> Right. Next time I see Crookshanks, I’ll let him know.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Hermione:</b> I meant me. <i>[suddenly, the vase on the table breaks]</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Hagrid:</b> Blimey. What was that? <i>[Hermione looks closely and finds a small rock with a snail shell pattern on it]</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Harry:</b> <i>[a rock hits him in the back of the head]</i> Ow. <i>[he turns around and looks out the window]</i> Hagrid. <i>[beckoning Hagrid to the window]</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Hagrid:</b> <i>[walking to the window and looking out]</i> Oh, crikey. <i>[Fudge, Dumbledore, and Macnair are walking towards Hagrid’s house, talking; Fudge glances at Buckbeak as he goes]</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Dumbledore:</b> No, Minister. Over this way.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Hagrid:</b> <i>[feeling very tense now]</i> It’s late. It’s nearly dark. You shouldn’t be here. <i>[going to his basket and grabbing a blanket]</i> Someone sees you outside the castle this time of night, you’ll be in trouble. Big trouble, particularly you, Harry. <i>[there is a knock at the door]</i> With you in a moment. <i>[throwing the blanket over his flobberworm]</i> Quick. Quick! <i>[Ron and Hermione head for the back door as Dumbledore knocks on the door again]</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Harry:</b> Hagrid. It’ll be fine. It’ll be okay.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Hagrid:</b> <i>[smiles slightly at Harry’s attempt to give him emotional support]</i> Go on. Go on!
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Dumbledore:</b> <i>[as Hermione opens the back door]</i> That’s the ling you can see over there on the slope. <i>[all three men have their backs turned, unaware that Harry and his friends are there; Hagrid opens the door to let them in]</i> Ah, Hagrid.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Hagrid:</b> Good evening, Professor Dumbledore. <i>[Fudge graciously steps inside]</i> Minister, just make your way through. Have a tea if you like.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Fudge:</b> <i>[obviously not thirsty]</i> No, Hagrid. <i>[Dumbledore and Macnair follow him inside]</i> Gentlemen...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Dumbledore:</b> <i>[Harry, Ron, and Hermione race to the rear of the pumpkin patch]</i> I’d like a cup of tea.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Fudge:</b> <i>[as Hagrid watches Harry, Ron, and Hermione leaving]</i> Well, I think we should get down to our business, shall we? Very well. It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff known as Buckbeak, hereafter called “The Condemned”, shall be executed this day at sundown.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Hagrid:</b> Dear, dear...
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Dumbledore:</b> Now, now, Hagrid. It’ll be all right.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Fudge:</b> <i>[as Harry, Ron, and Hermione continue eavesdropping from the pumpkin patch] The executioner shall dispatch the condemned by means of beheading. [Hermione hears a twig snap behind her and turns around]</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Harry:</b> What?
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Hermione:</b> I thought I just saw... Never mind.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Ron:</b> Let’s go.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><i>[As Harry, Ron, and Hermione run towards the steps leading back to the castle, Buckbeak suddenly looks up. Ron glances back at him as they go.]</i>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Hagrid:</b> Buckbeak didn’t mean no harm.
</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><i>[Buckbeak lets out an uneasy bray as he watches the three teenagers running back to the castle. Harry takes a last look at Buckbeak before racing after Ron and Hermione up the castle stairs. From the hilltop, Ron, Hermione, and Harry look down at Hagrid’s house. Hagrid and Dumbledore are standing on the front steps of the house, Fudge is standing right in front of the steps, and Macnair faces them, standing just inches from the pumpkin patch. Dumbledore points at the pumpkin patch; as he turns to go inside the cabin, Macnair raises his axe and walks toward Buckbeak, hidden from view by the trees. Hagrid sadly takes a last look at his feathered friend, then turns to go inside his house. Harry, Ron, and Hermione watch with mounting tension; even Scabbers seems a little skittish. Hermione closes her eyes briefly and murmurs. She silently gasps as she sees Macnair lift his axe above his head, tilt it backwards, then bring it down with lightning speed. A chopping sound is heard; the execution has been carried out. The crows that have been hanging around Macnair fly away, squawking and cawing.]</i>
