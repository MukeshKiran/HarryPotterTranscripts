    <p><i>[It is nighttime in Surrey, we see two owls on the street sign "PRIVET DRIVE" and the camera pans to the street with very identical looking brown bricked houses. One the owls fly away to reveal a elderly man with crimson robes, and the long silvery white beard named Albus Dumbledore walks through a forest near the street. He takes out his deliminator and activates it. Dumbledore zaps all the light out of the lampposts. He puts away the device and a cat meows. Dumbledore looks down at the cat, which is a tabby and is sitting on a brick ledge.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Dumbledore</b>: I should have known that you would be here...Professor McGonagall.
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[The cat meows, sniffs out and the camera pans back to a wall. We see that the cat's shadow progressing into a woman with a tall hat. There are footsteps and Minerva McGongall is revealed.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>McGonagall</b>: Good evening, Professor Dumbledore. Are the rumours true, Albus?
    </dd><dd><b>Dumbledore</b>: I'm afraid so, Professor. The good, and the bad.
    </dd><dd><b>McGonagall</b>: And the boy?
    </dd><dd><b>Dumbledore</b>: Hagrid is bringing him.
    </dd><dd><b>McGonagall</b>: Do you think it wise to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?
    </dd><dd><b>Dumbledore</b>: Ah, Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life.
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[There is a motor sound, and the two professors look up to see a flying motorcycle coming down from the air. It skids on the street and halts. A large man with shoulder length black hair and beard named Rubeus Hagrid, takes off his goggles.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Hagrid</b>: Professor Dumbledore, Sir. Professor McGonagall.
    </dd><dd><b>Dumbledore</b>: No problems, I trust, Hagrid?
    </dd><dd><b>Hagrid</b>: No, sir. Little tyke fell asleep just as we were flying over Bristol. Heh. Try not to wake him. There you go.
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Hagrid hands a baby wrapped in a bundle over to Dumbledore.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>McGonagall</b>: Albus, do you really think it's safe, leaving him with these people? I've watched them all day. They're the worst sort of Muggles imaginable. They really are...
    </dd><dd><b>Dumbledore</b>: The only family he has.
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[They stop outside a house which is 4 Privet Drive.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>McGonagall</b>: This boy will be famous. There won't be a child in our world who doesn't know his name.
    </dd><dd><b>Dumbledore</b>: Exactly. He's better off growing up away from all that. Until he is ready.
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Dumbledore places the baby on the ground slowly. Hagrid sniffles, he is sobbing a little. He clears his throat.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Dumbledore</b>: There, there, Hagrid. It's not really goodbye, after all.
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Hagrid nods. Dumbledore takes a letter and places it on the baby, who is now at the foot of the door.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Dumbledore</b>: Good luck...Harry Potter.
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[The baby has a lightning-bolt shaped scar on his forehead. The camera slowly zooms towards the scar which glows brightly and it immediately flashes, transitioning to a stormy cloud sky. The film's title in metallic gold zooms out around the camera, and lightning flashes to brighten it up. Then, the lightning flashes engulf the screen, transitioning it to the present time.]</i>
    </p>
    <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Vanishing_Glass">The Vanishing Glass</span></h2>
    <dl><dd><i>[The scar's glow immediately dies down, and the camera pans to see Harry who is now 10 years old, still sleeping. Then, the light turns on outside his bedroom cupboard under the stairs]</i>
    </dd><dd><b>Petunia</b>: Up. Get up. <i>[She knocks on his closet door repeatedly]</i> Now! <i>[Smacks door of closet and walks into the living room]</i>
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Harry wakes up, turns on his bedroom light and puts on his glasses with tape on the bridge, indicating that it was partly damaged. A large, tubby boy, Dudley Dursley, suddenly comes running down the stairs above the closet. He stops half-way down and goes back, jumping on the staircase.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Dudley</b>: Wake up, cousin! We're going to the zoo!
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Harry looks up to the join works of the stairs with small amounts of dusts rising. Dudley laughs, comes down the stairs and runs for the kitchen. Harry tries to come out of the closet, but is pushed back in by Dudley. Petunia is in the kitchen, where Dudley has gone.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Petunia</b>: Oh, here he comes, the birthday boy!
    </dd><dd><b>Vernon</b>: Happy birthday, son.
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Petunia and Dudley giggle together. Harry comes into the kitchen, dressed in outgrown clothes.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Petunia</b>: <i>[to Harry, unpleasantly]</i> Why don't you just cook the breakfast, and try not to burn anything.
    </dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: Yes, Aunt Petunia.
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Harry then gets to work on cooking the bacon]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Petunia</b>: I want everything to be perfect for my Dudley's special day.
    </dd><dd><b>Vernon</b>: <i>[to Harry, who is taking his time placing the bacon on the plates]</i> Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy!
    </dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: Yes, Uncle Vernon.
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Petunia leads Dudley over to the family room, where there are a vast amount of presents. Dudley stares.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Petunia</b>: Aren’t they wonderful, darling?
    </dd><dd><b>Dudley</b>: How many are there?
    </dd><dd><b>Vernon</b>: Thirty-six. Counted 'em myself.
    </dd><dd><b>Dudley</b>: Thirty-six?! But last year last year I had thirty-seven!!
    </dd><dd><b>Vernon</b>: Err yes, well, some of them are quite a bit bigger than last year.
    </dd><dd><b>Dudley</b>: I don't care how big they are!
    </dd><dd><b>Petunia</b>: <i>[calming him down]</i> Oh, now, now, now. This is what we're going to do, is that when we go out, we're going to buy you two new presents! How's that, pumpkin?
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Outside the house morning. The happy family is heading to the car.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Petunia</b>: This will be a lovely day at the zoo. I'm really looking forward to it.
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Harry then goes to go in the car, but Vernon stops him, pointing his keys at him.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Vernon</b>: I'm warning you now, boy. Any funny business, any at all, and you won't have any meals for a week. Get in.
    </dd></dl>
    <dl><dd><i>[At the London Zoo. The family is in the reptile house, looking at a large Boa constructor.]</i>
    </dd><dd><b>Dudley</b>: Make it move.
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Vernon taps the glass of the cage.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Vernon</b>: Move!
    </dd><dd><i>[Dudley taps the glass much harder, and Vernon nervously winces.]</i>
    </dd><dd><b>Dudley</b>: MOVE!
    </dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: He's asleep!
    </dd><dd><b>Dudley</b>: He's boring.
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Dudley and his parents head over to another enclosure. Harry is left with the snake.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Harry</b>: Sorry about him. He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after day, having people press their ugly faces in on you. <i>[The snake looks up and blinks.]</i> Can you...hear me? <i>[The snake nods]</i> It's just...I've never talked to a snake before. Do you...I mean...do you talk to people often? <i>[The snake shakes its head]</i> You're from Burma, aren't you? Was it nice there, do you miss your family? <i>[The snake turns its head in the direction of a sign which says, Bred in Captivity]</i> I see. That's me as well. I never knew my parents, either.
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[The now awake snake has attracted Dudley's attention. He comes over to the glass, knocking Harry to the floor.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Dudley</b>: Mummy, dad, come here! You won't believe what this snake is doing!
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Dudley puts his hands on the glass wall. With his back turned, Harry glares at him. Suddenly, the glass disappears, causing Dudley to wretch forward, losing his balance.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Dudley</b>: Whoa! Ahh! Ahh!!
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Dudley falls into the snake enclosure, sputtering in a pool of water. Harry snickers at what he saw. The snake gets out of the exhibit, stopping in front of Harry.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Snake</b>: Thanks.
    </dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: Anytime.
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[The snake slivers off to the exit.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Man</b>: SNAKE!
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[There is a lot of screaming as the snake heads for freedom. Dudley gets up to get out, but the glass is now back over the enclosure. Seeing that he is now trapped, he pounds the glass in panic.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Dudley</b>: Mum, mummy!
    </dd><dd><b>Petunia</b>: <i>[notices him in the exhibit]</i> AHH!
    </dd><dd><b>Dudley</b>: Mum, help! Help me!
    </dd><dd><b>Petunia</b>: My darling boy! How did you get in there?! How did you get in there? Dursley, oh, Dursley!
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Harry grins and snickers, Vernon notices this and glares down at him. Harry's grin disappears, knowing that he is in trouble with Vernon.]</i>
    </p>
    <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Letters_from_No_One">Letters from No One</span></h2>
    <p><i>[Back at the Dursleys'. Petunia and a bundled up Dudley come in.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Petunia</b>: <i>[assuring a distressed Dudley]</i> It's all right. It's all right.
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[They walk in the living room. Harry and Vernon enter. Vernon slams the door and shoves Harry against a wall, taking his hair.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Harry</b>: Ow!
    </dd><dd><b>Vernon</b>: What happened?!
    </dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: I swear I don't know! <i>[Vernon snarls]</i> One minute, the glass was there and then it was gone! It was like magic!
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Vernon scoffs at this, shoves Harry in the cupboard under the stairs and slams the door]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Vernon</b>: There's no such thing as magic! <i>[he blackens out the vent on the door]</i>
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[An owl flies into view and lands itself on a TV aerial on one of the houses' roof]</i>
    </p><p><i><b>(Extended Version)</b></i>
    </p><p><i>[The camera slowly pans up to reveal Dudley in his smartest school uniform, posing and smiling grandly.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Petunia</b>: Awww, smile. <i>[She takes a photograph of him. She gasps in joy.]</i> Vernon, just look at him. I can't believe it. In just a week you'll be off to Smeltings.
    </dd><dd><b>Vernon</b>: Caveat Smeltona. Proudest moment of my life.
    </dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: Will I have to wear that, too?
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[They draw their attention to Harry]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Petunia</b>: What, you? Go to Smeltings? <i>[Harry nods, questionably]</i>
    </dd><dd><b>Vernon</b>: Ha!
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[They laugh in amusement]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Petunia</b>: Oh, don't be so stupid, you're going to the state school where you belong. <i>[Goes to the kitchen and fishes out a grey shirt in a boiler.]</i> And this is what you're gonna be wearing when I've finished dyeing it.
    </dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: But that's Dudley's old uniform. It'll fit me like bits of old Elephant skin.
    </dd><dd><b>Petunia</b>: It'll fit you well enough. Go get the post. <i>[Harry then heads to the hallway]</i> Go!
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i><b>(Normal Version)</b></i>
    </p><p><i>[Harry leaves the living room area into the hallway and picks up some letters, one of which had his name on it with his address of where he slept. Uncle Vernon and Dudley sit at the table while Aunt Petunia is busy fixing breakfast. Harry walks in with the mail and hands it to Uncle Vernon, then walks to his seat with his letter.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Vernon</b>: <i>[after reading a postcard]</i> Oh, Marge is ill! Ate a funny whelk.
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Dudley suddenly notices Harry's letter and runs to grab it from him and give it to his father.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Dudley</b>: Dad! Look! Harry's got a letter!
    </dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: Hey, give it back! It's mine!
    </dd><dd><b>Vernon</b>: Yours? Who'd be writing to you?
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[The family gathers to look at the address. There is a broken seal on the letter. The family looks up and Harry gulps. Much later, another owl flies by with a letter and drops it off. Inside, Vernon grabs a handful of letters and rips them up. In the closet, Harry hears a whirring noise. He looks out at Vernon drilling wood over the letterbox opening.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Vernon</b>: No more mail through this letterbox.
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Harry quietly closes the cupboard door. The next day, Vernon and Petunia are outside the door. Vernon is about to head off to work. Petunia kisses his cheek.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Petunia</b>: Have a lovely day at the office, dear.
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[She stops, looks and sees a bunch of owls.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Vernon</b>: Shoo! Go on!
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[She notices something and pats Vernon on the shoulder to get his attention, and what they see is more letters addressed to Harry.]</i>
    </p><p><i><b>(Extended Version)</b></i>
    </p><p><i>[Later, Petunia is cracking a egg into a bowl, and what instead comes out is a folded-up letter. She cracks another one, but another letter comes out as well. She then cracks yet another one, but the same happens again. She stares at the letter, and then she hears the owls screeching. She draws her attention to the outside of the window, and what she sees is four owls sitting on some garden chairs. Petunia then screams and runs off.]</i>
    </p><p><i><b>(Normal Version)</b></i>
    </p><p><i>[Much later, Vernon is tossing letters into the fireplace. Harry comes around the corner. Vernon grins evilly and tosses more in. The scene fades to the next day, the family is sitting around, Harry is serving cookies.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Vernon</b>: Fine day Sunday. In my opinion, best day of the week. Why is that, Dudley?
    </dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: <i>[when Dudley shrugs and didn't answer, as Harry hands a cookie to Vernon]</i> Because there's no post on Sunday?
    </dd><dd><b>Vernon</b>: Ah, right you are, Harry. No post on Sunday. Ha! No blasted letters today. No, sir. Not one single bloody letter, not one. <i>[Harry sees a shadow outside the window. Outside, millions of owls are perched.]</i> No, sir, not one blasted, miserable-
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[As Vernon was talking, a letter shoots out of the fireplace and zips across Vernon's face, cutting him off. There is a rumbling and then millions of letters come shooting out of the fireplace. The family shrieks in horror as Harry watches in amazement.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Dudley</b>: AHH! Make it stop! Please make it stop! <i>[He jumps on Petunia's lap as she and Vernon continue screaming]</i>
    </dd><dd><b>Vernon</b>: Go away, ahh!
    </dd><dd><b>Dudley</b>: What is it? Please tell me what's happening!
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Harry jumps onto the coffee table to grab a letter. He gets one and starts to run away. Vernon jumps up as well.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Vernon</b>: Give me that! Give me that letter!
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[He chases Harry and grabs him before Harry gets into his closet.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Harry</b>: Get off! Ahh!
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Vernon restrains Harry as several letters begin to shoot everywhere around the house.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Vernon</b>: Ahh!
    </dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: They're my letters! Let go of me!
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[The wood plank nailed in front of the letterbox finally breaks from the excess pressure of the letters shooting through the letter.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Vernon</b>: That's it! We're going away! Far away! Where they can't find us!
    </dd><dd><b>Dudley</b>: Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?!
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Petunia watches with a horrified look on her face, knowing that Dudley may be right.]</i>
    </p>
    <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Keeper_of_the_Keys">Keeper of the Keys</span></h2>
    <p><i>[That stormy night, a tall house, on a rock island somewhere out at sea. The Dursleys, including Harry have moved there, due to the chaos with the letters. The family is sleeping, with Harry on the cold, dirt floor and Dudley sleeping on a sofa. Harry has drawn a birthday cake which reads, Happy Birthday Harry. Harry looks at Dudley's watch, which beeps 12:00.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Harry</b>: <i>[to himself]</i> Make a wish, Harry. <i>[he blows the "candles" on the drawn birthday cake]</i>
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Suddenly, the door thumps, in sync with the thunder flashing. Harry jumps. The door thumps again and Dudley and Harry jump up and back away. Harry hides behind a wall, and Dudley cowers on a windowsill. Petunia and Vernon appear, with Vernon holding a double barrel gun.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Vernon</b>: Who's there? Ahh!
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[The door bangs again and then falls down, and a giant man appears. As he comes into the clear lighting, he is revealed to be Hagrid.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Hagrid</b>: Sorry 'bout that. <i>[He puts the door back up]</i>
    </dd><dd><b>Vernon</b>: <i>[aiming his gun at him]</i> I demand that you leave at once, sir! You are breaking and entering!
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[As Petunia quietly gasps in fear, Hagrid grabs the gun and bends it upwards.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Hagrid</b>: Dry up, Dursley, you great prune. <i>[The gun fires upwards, blasting a hole in the ceiling, causing the two to shriek in fear. Hagrid notices Dudley.]</i> Boy, I haven't seen you since you was a baby, Harry, but you're a bit more along than I would have expected. Particularly 'round the middle!
    </dd><dd><b>Dudley</b>: I-I-I'm not Harry.
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Harry reveals himself]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Harry</b>: I-I am.
    </dd><dd><b>Hagrid</b>: Oh, well, of course you are! Got something for ya. 'Fraid I might have sat on it at some point! I imagine that it'll taste fine just the same. Ahh. Baked it myself. <i>[Hands Harry the cake]</i> Words and all. Heh.
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Harry opens cake, which reads "Happee Birdae Harry" in green frosting.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Harry</b>: Thank you!
    </dd><dd><b>Hagrid</b>: It's not every day that your young man turns eleven, now is it?
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Hagrid sits down on the sofa, takes out an umbrella and points it at the empty fire. Two sparks fly out and the fire starts. The family gasps.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Harry</b>: <i>[puts cake down]</i> Excuse me, who are you?
    </dd><dd><b>Hagrid</b>: Rubeus Hagrid. Keeper of keys and grounds at Hogwarts. Course, you'll know all about Hogwarts.
    </dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: Sorry, no.
    </dd><dd><b>Hagrid</b>: No? Blimey, Harry, didn't you ever wonder where your mum and dad learned it all?
    </dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: Learned what?
    </dd><dd><b>Hagrid</b>: You're a wizard, Harry.
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Harry looks confused]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Harry</b>: I-I'm a what?
    </dd><dd><b>Hagrid</b>: A wizard. And a thumping good one at that, I'd wager. Once you train up a little.
    </dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: No, you've made a mistake. I can't be...a-a wizard. I mean, I'm just... Harry. Just Harry.
    </dd><dd><b>Hagrid</b>: Well, just Harry. Did you ever make anything happen? Anything you couldn't explain when you were angry or scared? <i>[Harry softens his expression]</i> Ah.
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Dudley whimpers. Hagrid hands Harry the same letter that has been sent the past while. Harry opens it.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Harry</b>: Dear, Mr. Potter. We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts' School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
    </dd><dd><b>Vernon</b>: <i>[to Hagrid]</i> He'll not be going! We swore when we took him in, we’d put a stop to this rubbish!
    </dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: You knew? You knew all along and you never told me?
    </dd><dd><b>Petunia</b>: Of course we knew. How could you not be? My perfect sister being who she was. Oh, my mother and father were so proud the day she got her letter. We have a witch in the family. Isn't it wonderful? I was the only one to see her for what she was. A freak! And then she met that Potter, and then she had you, and I knew you'd be just the same, just as strange, just as ... abnormal. And then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up. And we got landed with you.
    </dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: <i>[to Petunia, angrily]</i> Blown up? You told me my parents died in a car crash!
    </dd><dd><b>Hagrid</b>: A car crash? A car crash kill James and Lily Potter?
    </dd><dd><b>Petunia</b>: We had to tell him something.
    </dd><dd><b>Hagrid</b>: It's an outrage! It's a scandal!
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[As the Dursleys argue with Hagrid, no one, including Harry, is noticing Dudley taking Harry's cake away]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Vernon</b>: He'll not be going!
    </dd><dd><b>Hagrid</b>: Oh, and I suppose a great Muggle like yourself's going to stop him, are you?
    </dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: Muggle?
    </dd><dd><b>Hagrid</b>: <i>[to Harry, calmly]</i> Non magic folk. <i>[he immediately draws his attention back to Vernon and Petunia in anger]</i> This boy's had his name down ever since he was born! <i>[As Hagrid was talking, Dudley was munching on Harry's cake.]</i> He's going to the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world, <i>and</i> he'll be under the finest headmaster that Hogwarts has ever seen: Albus Dumbledore.
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Harry smiles upon hearing Dumbledore's name]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Vernon</b>: I will not pay for some crackpot old fool to teach him magic tricks!
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Hagrid whips out his umbrella and points it at Vernon, threateningly.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Hagrid</b>: Never, insult Albus Dumbledore, in front of me.
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Hagrid finally sees Dudley eating Harry's cake, and aims his umbrella at his rear. He fires a magic spark at it, causing a grey tail to grow.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Dudley</b>: Ahh!
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[The Dursleys shriek in both fright and horror, as they run off out of sight. Harry laughs at this, so does Hagrid.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Hagrid</b>: Oh, um, I'd appreciate if you didn't tell anyone at Hogwarts about that. Strictly speaking, I'm not allowed to do magic.
    </dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: <i>[Nods]</i> Okay.
    </dd><dd><b>Hagrid</b>: <i>[checks his pocket-watch]</i> Ooh, we're a bit behind schedule. Best be off. <i>[he goes off to the door and pulls it down again, before stepping out. He turns to Harry]</i> Unless you'd rather stay, of course. Hmm?
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[He walks out. Harry grins, looks back at the direction where the Dursleys are gone, and grins again, before grabbing his jacket and joins Hagrid on their journey to London.]</i>
    </p>
    <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Diagon_Alley">Diagon Alley</span></h2>
    <p><i>[The next day, in the streets of London.]</i>
    </p><p><i><b>(Extended Version)</b></i>
    </p><p><i>[Harry and Hagrid are in the underground tube.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Harry</b>: <i>[reading the list]</i> First year students will require: three sets of work robes, one wand. <i>[He turns to Hagrid]</i>

    </dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: And...who owned that wand?
    </dd><dd><b>Ollivander</b>: Oh, we do not speak his name. The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. It's not always clear why, but I think it is clear that we can expect great things from you.

    <dl><dd><b>Oliver</b>: Quidditch is easy enough to understand. Each time has seven players, 3 chasers, 2 beaters, 1 keeper and a seeker. That's you. There are three kinds of balls. <i>[picks up a red one]</i> This one's called the Quaffle. Now, the chasers handle the Quaffle and try to put it through one of those three hoops. <i>[Points to the hoops in the Quidditch pitch in the distance.]</i> The keeper, that's me, defends the hoops. <i>[throws ball to Harry.]</i> With me so far?
    </dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: <i>[throws back]</i> I think so. What are those? <i>[points to two squirming chained down balls.]</i>
    </dd><dd><b>Oliver</b>: You better take this. <i>[hands Harry a small bat. He bends down and releases one ball. With an angry growl, it flies off into the air. The two boys watch it.]</i> Careful now, it's comin' back. <i>[The balls comes whizzing down, and Harry cracks at it with the bat. The ball soars off through a statue, surprisingly without damaging it.]</i> Eh, not bad, Potter, you'd make a fair beater... Uh-oh. <i>[The ball zooms down, and Oliver grabs it, wriggling to get it back in the box. He succeeds and is out of breath.]</i>
    </dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: What is that?
    </dd><dd><b>Oliver</b>: Bludger. Nasty little buggers. But you are the seeker, and the only thing I want you to worry about is this... the Golden Snitch. <i>[hands Harry a walnut sized golden ball.]</i>
    </dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: I like this ball.
    </dd><dd><b>Oliver</b>: Ah, you like it now. Just wait. It's wicked fast and damn near impossible to see.
    </dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: What do I do with it?
    </dd><dd><b>Oliver</b>: You catch it... before the other team's seeker. You catch this, the game is over. You catch this, Potter, and we win.

    </dd><dd><b>Hermione</b>: I went looking for the troll. I'd read about them and thought I could handle it. But I was wrong. If Harry and Ron hadn't come and found me...I'd probably be dead.
    </dd><dd><b>McGonagall</b>: Be that as it may be...it was an extremely foolish thing to do. <i>[Harry notices Snape's leg, which has the trousers' leg torn and a large cut on it. Snape notices and covers it up, glaring at Harry.]</i> I would have expected more rational behavior on your part, Miss Granger. Five points will be taken from Gryffindor for your serious lack of judgment. <i>[she turns to Harry and Ron]</i> As for you two gentlemen I just hope you realize how fortunate you are. Not many students could take on a fully grown mountain troll and live to tell the tale. Five points...will be awarded to each of you. <i>[Harry and Ron grin at each other]</i> For sheer dumb luck.

    </dd><dd><b>Harry:</b> That explains the blood.
    </dd><dd><b>Hermione:</b> Blood?
    </dd><dd><b>Harry:</b> Listen, last night, I'm guessing Snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog. But, he got himself bitten, that's why he's limping.
    </dd><dd><b>Hermione:</b> But why would anyone go near that dog?
    </dd><dd><b>Harry:</b> The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the vaults. He said it was Hogwarts' business, very secret.

    </dd><dd><b>Ron:</b> Fluffy?
    </dd><dd><b>Hermione:</b> That thing has a name?
    </dd><dd><b>Hagrid:</b> Well, of course he's got a name. He's mine. I bought him off an Irish feller I met down at the pub last year. Then I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the..
    </dd><dd><b>Harry:</b> Yes?
    </dd><dd><b>Hagrid:</b> Shouldn’t have said that. No more questions! Don’t ask any more questions. That's top secret, that is.
    </dd><dd><b>Harry:</b> But, Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it.
    </dd><dd><b>Hagrid:</b> Codswallop. Professor Snape is a Hogwarts teacher.
    </dd><dd><b>Hermione:</b> Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a spell when I see one. I've read all about them. You've got to keep eye contact and Snape wasn't blinking.
    </dd><dd><b>Harry:</b> Exactly.
    </dd><dd><b>Hagrid:</b> <i>[Sighs]</i> Now, you listen to me, all three of you. You're meddling in things that ought not to be meddled in. It's dangerous. What that dog is guarding is strictly between Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.

    </dd><dd><b>Hermione:</b> Good, you can help Harry, then. He's going to go and look in the library for information on Nicholas Flamel.

    </dd><dd><b>Ron:</b> <i>[Looks down at sweater]</i> Oh. My mum made it. <i>[Looking back up at Harry]</i> It looks like you've got one too.

    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Ron:</b> What is it?
    </dd><dd><b>Harry:</b> <i>[Looking down at the object]</i> It's some kind of cloak.
    </dd><dd><b>Ron:</b> Well, let's see then, put it on.
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Harry then wraps the cloak around his shoulders, making his body invisible]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Ron:</b> Whoa!
    </dd><dd><b>Harry:</b> <i>[Looks down at his invisible body]</i> My body's gone!
    </dd><dd><b>Ron:</b> I know what that is. That's an invisibility cloak.
    </dd><dd><b>Harry:</b> I'm invisible? <i>[Harry spins around, looking down at himself]</i>
    </dd><dd><b>Ron:</b> They're really rare. <i>[Ron looks down at the note]</i> I wonder who gave it to you?
    </dd><dd><b>Harry:</b> <i>[Now also looking down at the note]</i> There was no name. It just said use it well.

    </dd><dd><b>Quirrell:</b> W-what do you m-mean?
    </dd><dd><b>Snape:</b> You know perfectly well what I mean. <i>[Snape senses something who causes Harry to stop breathing. Snape reaches out to grab something, but doesn't. He whips his finger back in front of Quirrell's face.]</i> We'll have another chat soon...when you've had time to decide where your loyalties lie.

    <p><i>[Filch arrives, carrying the broken lantern.]</i>

    <dl><dd><b>Harry:</b> Mum? <i>[Lily nods and smiles]</i> Dad? <i>[James nods and smiles. Harry reaches out to touch them, but only gets the mirror. Then, his mother puts her hand on his shoulder. He puts his own hand on his own shoulders, as if trying to feel her there.]</i>

I trust by now you realize what it does. Let me give you a clue. The happiest man on earth would look into the mirror and see only himself, exactly as he is.
    </dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: So, then it shows us what we want? Whatever we want?
    </dd><dd><b>Dumbledore</b>: <i>[whilst looking at the mirror]</i> Yes...and no. It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desires of our hearts. Now you, who have never known your family, you see them standing beside you. But remember this, Harry. This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away in front of it, even gone mad. That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home, and I must ask you not to go looking for it again. It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry, and forget to live. <i>[Harry looks back at the mirror, knowing that Dumbledore is right.]</i>

    </dd><dd><b>Ron</b>: Copy off you?

    </dd><dd><b>Draco</b>: Scared, Potter?! <i>[He scoffs, but suddenly hears a howl]</i> Did you hear that? Come on, Fang. Scared.
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Harry and Draco approach a flat ground with gnarled roots all over. Fang stops, then growls.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Harry</b>: What is it, Fang?
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Up ahead is a cloaked figure who is crouching over a dead unicorn, drinking its blood from its wound. The figure raises its head, silver blood dripping from its mouth. Harry gasps and grabs his scar, which is hurting. Draco screams with pure fear and runs away with Fang.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Draco</b>: HELP!!!!!
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Harry is left by himself at the mercy of the figure who slides over the unicorn and rises erect. It advances towards Harry, who backs up, but trips. He crawls backwards. Suddenly, there is the sound of hoof-beats. A figure leaps over Harry and lands near the cloaked figure. It is a silver centaur called Firenze. It rears, and the cloaked figure retreats, flying away.]</i>

    <dl><dd><b>Firenze</b>: Harry Potter, you must leave. You are known to many creatures here. The forest is not safe at this time. Especially for you.
    </dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: But what was that thing you saved me from?
    </dd><dd><b>Firenze</b>: A monstrous creature. It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn. Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death. But at a terrible price. You have slain something so pure that the moment the blood touches your lips, you will have a half-life. A cursed life.
    </dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: But who would choose such a life?
    </dd><dd><b>Firenze</b>: Can you think of no one?
    </dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: Do you mean to say...that that thing that killed the unicorn...that was drinking its blood...that was Voldemort?
    </dd><dd><b>Firenze</b>: Do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?
    </dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: <i>[realizing]</i> The Philosopher's Stone.
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Fang suddenly barks and Harry looks up to see Hagrid, Hermione, Ron and Draco appear. Hagrid has his crossbow ready, but lowers it when he sees Firenze.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Hermione</b>: Harry!
    </dd><dd><b>Hagrid</b>: Hello there, Firenze. I see you've met our young Mr. Potter. You all right there, Harry? <i>[Harry nods]</i>
    </dd><dd><b>Firenze</b>: Harry Potter, this is where I leave you. You're safe now. Good luck.
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[He leaves as the group look at the dead unicorn.]</i>

    </dd><dd><b>Harry:</b> But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong! Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself; he wants the Stone for Voldemort. With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will be strong again. He'll... he'll come back.
    </dd><dd><b>Ron:</b> But, if he comes back, you don't think he'll try to... kill you, do you?
    </dd><dd><b>Harry:</b> I think if he'd had the chance, he might've tried to kill me tonight.

    </dd><dd><b>Hermione:</b> Hang on a minute. <i>[Harry and Ron both glance at her]</i> We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared? Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore's around, Harry, you're safe. As long as Dumbledore's around, you can't be touched. <i>[gives him a reassuring smile; he nods]</i>

    <p><i>[Harry walks down the stairs slowly. Halfway down, he winces, feeling his scar burning, and sees Professor Quirrell standing before the Mirror of Erised.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Harry</b>: You? <i>[Quirrell turns to face him]</i> No. I-it can’t be. Snape, h-he was the one—-
    </dd><dd><b>Quirrell</b>: Yes. He does seem the type, doesn’t he? Next to him, who would suspect p-p-p-poor st-stuttering Professor Quirrell?
    </dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: But-but that day, during the Quidditch match, Snape tried to kill me.
    </dd><dd><b>Quirrell</b>: <i>[smiling evilly]</i> No, dear boy. <i>I</i> tried to kill you. <i>[Harry eyes him in disbelief and confusion]</i> And trust me, if Snape’s cloak hadn’t caught fire and broken my eye contact, I would have succeeded, even with Snape muttering his little countercurse.
    </dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: Snape was trying to save me?
    </dd><dd><b>Quirrell</b>: I knew you were a danger to me right from the off. Especially after Halloween.
    </dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: Then-then you let the troll in.
    </dd><dd><b>Quirrell</b>: Very good, Potter, yes. Snape, unfortunately, wasn’t fooled. While everyone else was running about the dungeon, he went to the third floor to head me off. He, of course, never trusted me again. <i>[he turns towards the mirror again; Harry winces as his scar burns again]</i> He rarely left me alone. But he doesn’t understand. I’m never alone, never. <i>[staring into the mirror]</i> Now, what does this mirror do? I see what I desire. I see myself holding the stone. But how do I get it?
    </dd><dd><b>Unseen Inhuman Voice</b>: Use the boy. <i>[Harry looks around, wondering where the voice is coming from]</i>
    </dd><dd><b>Quirrell</b>: <i>[turns to Harry]</i> Come here, Potter. Now! <i>[Harry slowly walks down the stairs, towards Quirrell and the mirror]</i> Tell me... what do you see? <i>[Harry looks into the mirror, and for a few seconds, sees him standing next to Quirrell, then his reflection reaches into its pocket and pulls out a gleaming red ruby, the Philosopher’s Stone; Harry stares in amazement as his reflection smiles and winks, then puts the stone back in its pocket; Harry feels his pocket and realizes the Stone really is in his pocket, then looks up again]</i> What is it? <i>[glances at Harry while speaking]</i> What do you see?
    </dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: <i>[looks at Quirrell, then back at the mirror, determined not to let Quirrell know that he has the Stone]</i> I-I’m shaking hands with Dumbledore. I’ve won the House Cup.
    </dd><dd><b>Unseen Inhuman Voice</b>: He lies.
    </dd><dd><b>Quirrell</b>: <i>[angrily shouting]</i> Tell the truth! What do you see?!
    </dd><dd><b>Unseen Inhuman Voice:</b> Let me speak to him.
    </dd><dd><b>Quirrell</b>: <i>[as Harry backs away]</i> Master, you are not strong enough.
    </dd><dd><b>Unseen Inhuman Voice</b>: I have strength enough for this.
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Quirrell reaches up and starts unwrapping his turban as he turns so his back is to the mirror. Harry turns toward the staircase into the room, wondering whether he should try to escape, then turns towards Quirrell again. He is almost finished unwrapping his turban, save for a piece covering the back of his head. Finally, he removes the turban, revealing a scary-looking chalk white face, Voldemort. He cranes around and opens his eyes.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Voldemort</b>: Harry Potter, we meet again.
    </dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: <i>[realizing his identity]</i> Voldemort.
    </dd><dd><b>Voldemort</b>: Yes. You see what I’ve become? See what I must do to survive? Live off another, a mere parasite. Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can, something that, conveniently enough, lies in your pocket. <i>[realizing Voldemort is referring to the Philosopher’s Stone, Harry turns and runs back up the stairs]</i>
    </dd></dl>
    <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Magic_Touch">Magic Touch</span></h2>
    <dl><dd><b>Voldemort</b>: Stop him. <i>[Quirrell snaps his fingers, instantly causing fire walls to block all the exits, trapping Harry in the room]</i> Don't be a fool! Why suffer a horrific death when you can join me and live?!
    </dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: <i>[shakes his head]</i> Never!
    </dd><dd><b>Voldemort</b>: Haha. Bravery. Your parents had it too. Tell me, Harry, would you like to see your mother and father again? Together, we can bring them back. <i>[In the mirror, Harry's parents appear in the reflection.]</i> All I ask for is something in return. <i>[Harry takes the Stone from his pocket.]</i> That's it, Harry. There is no good and evil. There is only power, and those too weak to seek it. Together, we'll do extraordinary things. Just give me the stone! <i>[James and Lily Potter fade from the reflection]</i>
    </dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: You liar!
    </dd><dd><b>Voldemort</b>: Kill him!
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Under orders, Quirrell soars into the air and grabs hold of Harry with one hand on his throat. They fall to the steps, causing the Stone falls out of Harry's reach as Quirrell chokes him. Harry strains and squeaks. Suddenly, Harry puts his hand on Quirrell's hand in an attempt to get him off. Smoke furls from under his hand as Quirrell winces.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Quirrell</b>: Ahh! Ahh! <i>[He backs up away from Harry. His hand is crumbling into ash and dust.]</i> What is this magic? <i>[His hand disintegrates]</i>
    </dd><dd><b>Voldemort</b>: Fool! Get the stone!
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Quirrell walks forward towards Harry, who then touches his face with his hands, causing Quirrell to scream in pain, and especially Voldemort to wince. Harry looks on horrified as Quirrell backs up with his face horrendously burned. Quirrell crumbles as he walks forward, turning his body completely in ash and dust, and falls to the floor, leaving only his clothing. Harry gasps, as he looks at his own hands and hurries over to the stone. He picks it up and sighs. However, from behind, dust clouds form from Quirrell's corpse, causing Harry to turn around as the dust clouds with Voldemort's face rushes forward screaming and goes through Harry who also screams. Voldemort flies away, as Harry falls to the ground, unconscious. He holds the Stone in an outstretched hand.]</i>

    <p><i>[In the hospital wing the next day, Harry is lying in bed with his arm bandaged. He awakens, puts on his glasses, and sits up. There are cards and candy all over. Dumbledore approaches him.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Dumbledore</b>: Good afternoon, Harry. Ah. Tokens from your admirers?
    </dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: Admirers?
    </dd><dd><b>Dumbledore</b>: What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. <i>[They both smile.]</i> Ah, I see your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your Chocolate Frogs.
    </dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: Ron was here? Is he all right? What about Hermione?
    </dd><dd><b>Dumbledore</b>: Fine. They're both just fine.
    </dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: But, what happened to the Stone?
    </dd><dd><b>Dumbledore</b>: Relax, dear boy. The stone has been destroyed. My friend Nicholas and I had a little chat and agreed it was best all around.
    </dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: But Flamel, he'll die, won't he?
    </dd><dd><b>Dumbledore</b>: <i>[sits on the bed.]</i> He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. But yes, he will die.
    </dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: How is it I got the Stone, sir? One minute I was staring in the mirror, and the next...
    </dd><dd><b>Dumbledore</b>: Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone, find it, but not use it, would be able to get it. That is one of my more brilliant ideas. And between you and me that's saying something.
    </dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: Does that mean, with the Stone gone, I mean, that Voldemort can never come back?
    </dd><dd><b>Dumbledore</b>: Ah, I'm afraid there are ways in which he can return. Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him? <i>[Harry shakes his head.]</i> It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act leaves a mark. <i>[Harry touches his scar.]</i> No, no, this kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin.
    </dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: What is it?
    </dd><dd><b>Dumbledore</b>: Love, Harry, love. <i>[Pats Harry's head gently and stands up.]</i> Ah. Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans. I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavored one, and since then I have lost my liking for them. But I think I could be safe with a nice toffee...<i>[takes brown bean and eats it.]</i> Mm. Alas. Earwax.
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Harry with his arm still bandaged enters a corridor where up on a stairwell balcony, Hermione and Ron are talking. They stop when they see Harry and lean over the railing.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Harry</b>: All right there, Ron?
    </dd><dd><b>Ron</b>: All right? You?
    </dd><dd><b>Harry</b>: <i>[as he shrugs]</i> All right. Hermione?

    <h2><span class="mw-headline" id="House_Cup_Winner">House Cup Winner</span></h2>
    <p><i>[We see the Great Hall, full of students eating and talking with each other. There are green and silver banners with the Slytherin symbol above their heads, already indicating the house with the most points. Dumbledore gives a slight nod to professor McGonagall, who then clinks her spoon to her glass, to ask attention from the students. The crowd falls silent. Dumbledore stands up and speaks with his magically magnified voice.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Dumbledore</b>: Another year, gone! And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarded and the points stand thus. In fourth place: Gryffindor, with 312 points! <i>[There is a medium applause from the crowd.]</i> In third place: Hufflepuff, with 352 points! <i>[The applause for Hufflepuff is slightly louder than the clapping for Gryffindor.]</i> Second: Ravenclaw, with 426 points! <i>[Applause again, this time with a slight cheer from some students.]</i> And in first place, with 472 points: Slytherin house! <i>[A loud roar rises from the Slytherin table, as students stand up and clap for their selves. Malfoy gives a mean look to the Gryffindor table, where Harry, Ron and Hermione look slightly depressed.]</i> Yes, well done Slytherin, well done Slytherin. However, recent events must be taken into account and I have a few last minute points to award. <i>[Some faces at the Gryffindor table rise hopefully.]</i> First, to Miss Hermione Granger, for the cool use of intellect while others were in grave peril: fifty points! <i>[Hermione looks surprised, while the other Gryffindor students applaud her. Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle don't like what's happening. Hermione looks at Hagrid, who looks back to her with a proud smile.]</i> Second, to Mr Ronald Weasley, for the best played game of chess that Hogwarts has seen these many years: fifty points! <i>[Ron looks even more surprised than Hermione did and the Gryffindor table is applauding even louder.]</i> And third, to mister Harry Potter, for pure love and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house: sixty points!
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[The Gryffindors cheer again, this time even louder than before. Malfoy has a cringing look on his face, while Harry sees a proud, smiling professor McGonagall at the teacher's table. Hermione, who has done some quick math, whispers to her fellow students.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Hermione: </b>We're tied with Slytherin!
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[Now, the Gryffindors look really hopeful, as Dumbledore hasn't finished talking yet.]</i>
    </p>
    <dl><dd><b>Dumbledore: </b>And finally: it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends. I award ten points to Neville Longbottom! <i>[Neville can't believe what he just heard and the Gryffindors that heard Hermione's whisper are cheering the loudest. Malfoy looks quite uncertain now.]</i> Assuming that my calculations are correct, I believe that a change of decoration is in order! <i>[He motions his hands towards the Slytherin banners, where they flap heavily, until the banners have changed completely to red and gold with the Gryffindor symbol]</i> Gryffindor wins the House Cup!
    </dd></dl>
    <p><i>[The Great Hall exploded with roars and applause, not only from the Gryffindors, but also from the Ravenclaws and the Hufflepuffs, because they are glad that, for the first time in seven years, someone else than Slytherin has won the House Cup. Hagrid can't help himself to also cheer, and all students except the Slytherins throw their hats in the air, while Malfoy angrily throws his on the table in defeat. The Gryffindors around Harry are all congratulating him and Harry smiles to Hagrid, who smiles back.]</i>
